This AddOn fixes Esc button functionality on Warmane WotLK realms. When pressing Esc button while targeting something, first press should deselect the target and second press should open game menu. Currently on Warmane WotLK realms first press of Esc button both deselects the target and opens game menu. This AddOn restores the original functionality of Esc button.
